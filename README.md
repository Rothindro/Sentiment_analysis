## üìåOverview:

Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is an NLP technique that detects emotions (positive, negative, neutral) in text. It helps businesses understand public perception by analyzing social media, reviews, and customer feedback.
In this rise of AI in business, AI/ML-based sentiment analysis tools can help in many ways, like:

- Tracking customer sentiment about products/services in real-time
- Detect PR crises early (e.g., sudden spike in negative tweets)
- Automatically categorize support tickets by urgency (anger = high priority)
- Improve products based on recurring complaints in reviews &
- Compare sentiment toward competitors to identify market gaps, etc
  
Employing this system in a gaming environment will help to track toxic behaviour among players, improve community engagement, etc.
